**DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS 5E SCRAPPER**

Important note: This is a big WIP

The goal of this is to make a nodejs script that can turn the source book of dungeons and dragons 5E into exploitable data, with minimal human intervention.

There is basically two parts of the script: the scrapper itself and a parser to make the data readable

_Scrapper_

Scrappers are tailor-made for each book, but logic will stay consistent between them.
